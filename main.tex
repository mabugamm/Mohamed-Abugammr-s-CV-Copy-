% \cvevent{Oil Tank Vibration}{
% (Toyota Motor Europe- Active Structure Lab)}{ 2015 } {Brussels}
% The oil tank that was considered for this project was going to installed on regional chariness airplane. The main purpose of this project is focus on the numerical simulation of the behaviors of the structure of the oil tank. The study was carried in both frequency domain and time domain.  An experiment setup was also designed in order to study and test the technology used to solve the vibration and noise into the oil tank I was responsible for:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item 3D drawing.
%     Using: CATIA.

% \cvevent{Active Vibration Isolation of Spacecraft }{
% Europe Space Agency}{ 2017 } {Brussels}
% Earth observation satellite and space telescope are subject to jitter generated by Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA) of the attitude control system. This limits the spatial resolution of the observation instruments. This project considers various options of vibration isolation and evaluate them, especially for their interaction with attitude control of the spacecraft.

% \cvevent{ 	Building seismic}{
% Europe Space Agency}{ 2017 } {Brussels}
% Recently, a number of high-rise buildings and huge bridge towers equipped with control technologies have been constructed. For example, Taipei 101 tower (the 508m high, 101 floors building) is equipped with vibration control techniques, these methods have been sought as countermeasures against strong winds.
